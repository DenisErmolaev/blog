## 🗂 Version Control. Git — The Foundation of Modern Programming  

**Git** is a distributed version control system that has become the standard in software development, research, and data analysis.

### 🔄 What is version control?
- A system for tracking changes in code, documents, or any digital assets.  
- Enables you to restore any previous version of a project, see who made which changes, and collaborate without conflicts.

### 🛠 What is Git?
- **Git** was developed by Linus Torvalds to manage the Linux kernel's source code.  
- It allows full repositories with history to be stored locally, without relying on a central server.  
- Git supports branching, merging, resetting, reverting, and many other code management tools.

### 💡 Why is Git a must-have?
- 🧠 **Project history** — restore any version, understand when and why changes were made.  
- 🤝 **Collaboration** — multiple contributors can work simultaneously and merge their changes.  
- 🔍 **Transparency and auditability** — identify errors and track contributions.  
- 🚀 **Automation and CI/CD** — Git is the backbone of modern build, test, and deployment workflows.

### ⚙️ Key Git commands
- `git init` — initialize a repository  
- `git clone <url>` — copy a remote repository  
- `git add <file>` — stage a file for commit  
- `git commit -m "Message"` — save a snapshot of changes  
- `git push` / `git pull` — send/receive changes to/from a remote repository  
- `git branch` / `git checkout` / `git merge` — manage branches

### 🗂 Git in Academic and Research Work
- Track lab and coursework with version history and rollback options  
- Collaborate on group projects with branch isolation  
- Keep code, reports, and publications organized in one system  
- Build a professional portfolio using GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket

Git is more than a tool — it's an essential skill for every modern specialist. It supports a structured, safe, and collaborative approach to work. Even when working solo, Git helps you better manage your learning and research process.
